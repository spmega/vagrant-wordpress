# vagrant-wordpress
This is a setup with vagrant and virtualbox. I use an ubuntu xenial 16.04 box, and download the latest wordpress installation,
and set it up on Apache2. The entire installation is done in script, in install_wordpress.sh. The only thing the usr must do is
to follow the wordpress set up giude for setting up your first site. The ip address is 192.168.99.99.
